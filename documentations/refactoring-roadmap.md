ðŸ”§ Comprehensive Refactoring Roadmap

### 1. Backend Refactoring

**Phase 1**: Code Organization

- Create a unified error handling middleware
- Implement a logging service instead of console.log
- Extract common functionality to shared utility functions
- Standardize response formats across all controllers

**Phase 2**: Security & Performance

- Implement comprehensive input validation using a library like Joi or Yup
- Move hardcoded values to environment variables
- Optimize database queries to reduce redundant operations
- Implement more efficient authentication with refresh tokens

**Phase 3**: Testing & Documentation

- Increase test coverage with meaningful unit and integration tests
- Document API endpoints with Swagger or similar tool
- Establish consistent API response codes and error messages

### 2. Frontend Refactoring

**Phase 1**: Code Organization

- Standardize file naming conventions (pick camelCase or PascalCase)
- Break large components into smaller, focused components
- Consolidate duplicate components (SummaryCards + SummaryCardsHumphrey)
- Create a consistent component structure (props, state, effects, render)

**Phase 2**: State Management

- Optimize context usage to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper loading and error states across all components
- Extract business logic from UI components into custom hooks or service functions
- Clean up unused code and comments

**Phase 3**: Performance & UX

- Implement code splitting for larger page components
- Add comprehensive form validation
- Create a component library for consistent UI elements
- Optimize API calls with caching and deduplication

### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Phase 1**: Build Process

- Implement ESLint and Prettier with strict rules to enforce code style
- Add automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality

**Phase 2**: Documentation

- Create comprehensive documentation for both backend and frontend
- Document the component hierarchy and data flow
- Improve inline code documentation

**Phase 3**: Architecture Improvements

- Consider implementing a more robust state management solution
- Evaluate moving to TypeScript for better type safety
- Improve responsiveness and accessibility
