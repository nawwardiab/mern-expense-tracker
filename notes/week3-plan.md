### Week 3: Expense Management (Backend + Frontend Integration)

**Goal**: Achieve complete integration of frontend and backend for expense management functionalities, ensuring seamless CRUD operations and basic filtering.

### Deliverables by end of Week 3:

1. Fully functional CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for expenses.
2. Frontend integration enabling adding, viewing, editing, and deleting expenses.
3. Basic filtering (by category, date) implemented.

### Task Breakdown & Assignment:

**Developer A (Backend Specialist)**

- Implement Expense CRUD API:
  - `POST /expenses`: Add new expenses.
  - `GET /expenses`: Retrieve expenses, supporting query parameters (filter by category, date).
  - `PUT /expenses/:id`: Update existing expenses.
  - `DELETE /expenses/:id`: Delete expenses.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for:
  - Expense model validation and database interactions.
  - Expense controllers (API logic).

**Developer B (Frontend - Form & Display)**

- Frontend CRUD Interface:
  - Develop a page/component for listing all expenses (ExpensesList).
  - Implement the 'Add Expense' form component.
  - Integrate the 'Add Expense' form with `POST /expenses` API endpoint.
- Testing & Debugging:
  - Ensure seamless form submission and real-time list updates after adding an expense.
- Assist Developer D in styling and UX refinements.

**Developer C (Frontend - Filtering & Summaries)**

- Filtering & Summary:
  - Create UI for filtering expenses by category and date range.
  - Integrate filtering with backend (`GET /expenses?category=x&date=y`).
- If time permits:
  - Develop a basic summary dashboard (total expenses, breakdown by category).
  - Integrate summary data with `GET /expenses/summary` endpoint (coordinate with Developer A).

**Developer D (Frontend - Reusable Components & UI Polish)**

- Component Development & Integration:
  - Develop reusable components (`ExpenseCard` / `ExpenseItem`) to display individual expense details.
  - Add edit/delete functionality for each expense item, integrating with backend (`PUT /expenses/:id`, `DELETE /expenses/:id`).
- Frontend Polish:
  - Ensure responsive design, usability, and visual coherence across components.

### Collaboration & Integration Strategy

- Developers A & B will closely coordinate the backend-frontend integration for adding and listing expenses.
- Developers C & D collaborate on frontend interactions and filtering features to ensure cohesive API integration.
- Regular daily stand-ups for progress checks and solving integration issues promptly.

### Testing & Documentation

- Developer A leads unit tests for backend components.
- Developer B & D validate frontend integration with backend endpoints and UI/UX quality assurance.
- All developers conduct end-to-end tests collaboratively before the final weekly review.
