Below is a comprehensive development strategy and timeline for the 7-week final MERN project, broken down by tasks and assigned responsibilities among the four developers (A, B, C & D). The plan ensures that each developer touches both backend and frontend.

---

## 1. Git & GitHub Workflow

1. **Repository Structure**

   - One main GitHub repository named, for example, `mern-expense-tracker`.
   - Two main branches:
     - **`main`**: Production-ready branch, used only for stable releases.
     - **`dev`**: Development branch where features are merged before moving to `main`.
   - **Feature branches** (e.g., `feature/user-auth-backend`, `feature/expense-frontend`), created from `dev`.
     - Each developer works on a feature branch.
     - After completing a feature and testing locally, open a **Pull Request** (PR) to `dev`.
   - **Release Branches** (optional if the team wants to do staging/testing merges before pushing to `main`).

2. **Pull Request & Code Review Process**

   - Each developer creates a PR from their feature branch into `dev`.
   - At least **one** other team member reviews the PR and provides feedback (especially A & B can mentor C & D).
   - Once approved, merge into `dev`.
   - When `dev` is stable and tested, merge `dev` into `main` for the final release.

3. **Commit Standards**

   - Use meaningful commit messages with a short summary and optional more detailed description, for example:
     - `feat: add user authentication API endpoint`
     - `fix: correct routing issue in expense controller`
     - `refactor: improve form validation logic in frontend`
   - Keep commits small and frequent, so the entire team can track changes easily.

4. **Branch Naming Convention**
   - **`feature/<short-description>`** for new features (e.g., `feature/user-registration`).
   - **`fix/<short-description>`** for bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-token-issue`).
   - **`refactor/<short-description>`** for refactoring tasks.
   - **`docs/<short-description>`** for documentation updates.

This workflow will help maintain code quality, encourage team collaboration, and reduce merge conflicts.

## Final Notes

1. **Communication**
   - Maintain ongoing communication via Slack or Discord, and short daily standups to remove blockers.
2. **Documentation**
   - Keep the README updated for new contributors or for quick reference.
   - Each route or module should have short code comments for clarity.
3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Use GitHub Projects or Trello board to organize tasks, track progress, and ensure everything is visible.
4. **Build in Buffer Time**
   - The above timeline is an ideal scenario; keep some buffer for unexpected issues.
5. **Presentation Strategy**
   - Live demo showcasing key features (authentication, adding/editing expenses, group splitting, stats).
   - Possibly a short slide deck describing tech stack, architecture, and lessons learned.

By following this detailed plan, the team can systematically build out the MERN Expense Tracker in 7 weeks, ensuring each developer gets hands-on experience with both backend and frontend while delivering a polished final product.
